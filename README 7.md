Task 7 : Creating Views

Objective:
Learn how to create and use Views in SQL to simplify complex queries and improve data abstraction.

Tools Used:
DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

Description:
In this task, a View is created using the CREATE VIEW statement that stores a complex SELECT query as a virtual table. Views allow easier data access and improve database security by restricting direct access to underlying tables.
You can use the view just like a regular table to query data, filter, and join with other tables.

Outcome:
Learned how to create, query, and manage views.
Understood how views help in data abstraction, simplifying complex queries, and enhancing security.
Gained the ability to create reusable SQL logic for real-world database scenarios.

Key Concepts:
Views, Data Abstraction, Virtual Tables, Query Simplification
